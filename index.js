This might mean we'd switch our main storage from mongodb to something smaller like SQLite and having an robust disk db solution. We'd also want to not depend on Redis or only depend on Redis for both storage and queue. This decision has helped to separate critical parts of code to different packages and weâ€™ve seen increased reliability in our production instance. In the past we used to scale up both server and worker, now we can scale up server and worker workloads independently. Now i have added some files i want to see if it can merge sucessfully and reach one thousand characters with out stopping or breaking ,so i dont look like a useless developer`;
